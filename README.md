## Valley Metro Live

This project displays realtime transit vehicle locations for the Phoenix, Arizona metro area serviced by Valley Metro.

Data can be found [here](https://www.phoenixopendata.com/dataset/general-transit-feed-specification).

Currently this information is only available in a user-friendly format via the official Valley Metro mobile application.
Not all riders have a mobile device capable of using the app, so having this information available on a webpage that can be accessed without an account on a public device makes this information more widely available.
